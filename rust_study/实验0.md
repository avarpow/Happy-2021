I think, possibly, maybe, I found the solution.

VS Code has settings where you can configure match patterns to tell it to not include certain files and/or directories for searching, watching, etc.

I went into File -> Preferences -> Setting. In there I find Text editor -> Files. In there I find some places to add match patterns for Files: Exclude , Files Watcher: Exclude and Search: Exclude,

I add the pattern **/target/** to all of those.

And restart VS code.
